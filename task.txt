Day 1 Task:

1.Difference between HTTP 1.1 to HTTP2:
			HTTP stands for “Hypertext Transfer Protocol”.Which is used for client-server communication.

HTTP 1.1

3.Its need single TCP connections because of Multiplexed.
4.Addition of server push function(send related file without request)

2.Objects and its  internal representation in javascript:
		JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language,
         so everything in JavaScript is an object.A JavaScript object is like a real-world entity having state and behavior, 
         for example, a car. We can take a car as an object. It will have a state like color and model.
          It will also have behaviors like accelerating and brake.
          JavaScript is template based and we can create objects without the need of having a class. 
          Generally, an object is accompanied by a class that defines an object’s blueprints but JavaScript doesn’t require any 
          class to be defined for the object..
